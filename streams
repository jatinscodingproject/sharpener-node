streams are onbject that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in countinuous fashion.
In node js there are four type of streams.
streaming means listening music or watching video in real time instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later.

readable:- stream which is used for read operation
writeable:-stream which is used for write operation
Duplex:- stream which can be used for both read and write operation.
Transform:- A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.


Each type of stream is an event emitter instance and throws several events at different instances of time for example some commonly used events are:-
data:- This event is fired when there is data is available to read.
end:- This event is fired where there is no more data to read.
error:- This event is fired where there is any error receiving or writing data.
finish:- This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.
